# MOVE
This repository contains the source code for our paper 
*MOVE: Integrating Multi-source Information for Predicting Drug-target Interaction through Multi-view Contrastive Learning*.

In this work, we propose an end-to-end model named MOVE, to integrate multi-source information for predicting DTI via cross-view contrastive
learning. MOVE extracts information from the sequence view and
the network view, then utilizes a fusion module with auxiliary
contrastive learning to facilitate the fusion of representations.
